* QTL
  - Quantitative Trait Locus 
  - See [[./QTL.org]]

* Phenotype 
  - The physical manifestation of a trait

* Genotype
  - The genetic makeup of an individual organism

* Nucleotide
  - Building blocks of nucleic acids
  - Basis of constructing DNA

* SNPs
  - Single*nucleotide polymorphism 
  - Is a region of DNA which varies 
  - i.e. C*G changing to a T*A in one specific place
  - Can be found through the PCR process (amongst others)

* DNA
  - Deoxyribonucleic acid
  - Is a molecule that carries all genetic instructions of a living organism

* Chromosome
  - is a DNA molecule that has been packaged into thread-like structures
  - Each chromosome is made up of DNA tightly coiled many times around proteins called histones
  - Is visible under microscope when cells are dividing. 
  - Linear arrangements of condensed DNA

* Ploidy
  - The number of sets of chromosomes in a cells
  - The possible number of alleles for autosomal and pseudoautosomal genes

* Gene
  - A region of DNA
  - Made up of nucleotides
  - Sometimes called locus of DNA
  - Is the molecular unit of heredity 

* Genome
  - Encompasses DNA, RNA and mitochrondria/chroloplasts of an organism. 

* Homozygous 
  - An gene is said to be homozygous  when identical alleles of the gene are present on all chromosomes
  - Homozygous*dominant for a trait carries multiple copies for the dominant trait

* Heterozygous 
  - A gene is said to be heterozygous when at a gene locus there is two different alleles (copies of the same gene)

* Homologous Chromosomes
  - Are the set made from both parents during meiosis
  - Homologs have the same genes in the same loci where they provide points along each chromosome
  - They enable a pair of chromosomes to align correctly before separating during meiosis
  - Fig. 1 Illustrates this process

#+CAPTION: During the process of meiosis, homologous chromosomes can recombine and produce new combinations of genes in the daughter cells.

* Recombinaton 
  - Is a process by which pieces of DNA are borken and recombined to produce new combinations of alleles
  - In eukaryotic cells, this typically happens during meiosis
  - Genes that are located further apart on the same chromosome have a greater chance of undergoing recombination



* Meiosis 
  - Is a form of cell division that produces gametes
  - During the first phase of meiosis, the homologous pairs of parental chromosomes can overlap and temporally fuse, causing a crossover


* Gametes

* Backcross 
* Alleles 
* Chromosomes
* Recombination
* Progeny 
* Transcription 
* Candidate gene
* Mendelian inheritance
* Heritability
